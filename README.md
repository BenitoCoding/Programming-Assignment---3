# Programming-Assignment---3
This repository contains the Programming Assignment #3 solutions. This Programming Assignment focuses on the usage of the Panda function which includes its library to help the students know how to create a Python program using the Pandas library.

# Problem 1 - Loading cars.csv
In this problem, the students were tasked to load a file called "cars.csv" to which they will turn it into a data frame using pandas.

The students first loaded the "cars.csv" into the Jupyter Notebook. They have the option to display the list as seen on the picture.

The "cars.head()" and "cars.tail()" displays the first 5 and the last 5 of the column which is for the required.

The file was saved as "Surname_Pandas-P1.py", which bases to the requirements of the problem. The code won't run if the file name is not named as the file requirement.

# Problem 2 - Operations for Problem 1

In this problem, the students were tasked to use the data frames of Problem 1 and extract the following using subsetting, slicing, and indexing.

The students first loaded the "cars.csv" into the Jupyter Notebook. Similarly to Problem 1, they have the option to display the list as seen on the picture.

The "iloc []" allows the student to select a specific row and column using their integer position. This will also slice the column on the specific position.
