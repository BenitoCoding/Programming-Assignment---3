This repository contains the Programming Assignment #3 solutions. This Programming Assignment focuses on the usage of the Panda function which includes its library to help the students know how to create a Python program using the Pandas library.

# Problem 1 - Loading cars.csv
In this problem, the students were tasked to load a file called "cars.csv" to which they will turn it into a data frame using pandas.

The file was saved as "Surname_Pandas-P1.py", which bases to the requirements of the problem. The code won't run if the file name is not named as the file requirement.
